97.1 Compilation Problems
-------------------------

(*** also in INSTALL.zxid)

* Makefile tries to compile a bunch of check programs early in the
  compilation to detect common problems with missing headers (include
  files) and missing libraries.
* If the checks fail, you need to adjust the -I and -L flags in Makefile
  variables CDIR and LIBS (around line 123)
* Alternately you can create localconf.mk file that will be
  included by the main Makefile and put your modifications there.
* ZXID dependency libraries are libcurl, openssl (libssl, libcrypto), and zlib
* Although compiling the dependency libraries from source is adviced,
  usually you can use the versions that are supplied with your distribution.
  However in this case you MUST install also the headers. Usually these
  are called "development" packages.
* zxid assumes openssl, libcurl, Java, and Apache to be installed
  in the locations where source distributions of those packages
  install them in their default configuration (e.g. /usr/local/ssl,
  /usr/local/httpd, etc.)
* Many distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Redhat, SUSE, ...) choose to install
  those libraries in different places, thus requiring distribution
  specific edits to localconf.mk
* If you have difficulty in finding the headers and libraries (or whether
  a package is installed at all), try the following commands

    find / -name 'stdio.h'
    find / -name 'libc.*'
    find / -name 'zlib.h'
    find / -name 'libz.*'
    find / -name 'opensslv.h'
    find / -name 'libssl.*'
    find / -name 'libcrypto.*'
    find / -name 'curlver.h'
    find / -name 'libcurl.*'
    find / -name 'ap_release.h'
    find / -name 'apr_version.h'
    find / -name 'libapr-1.*'
    find / -name 'servlet-api.jar'

  If you find more than one of any of the above, you need to be extra
  careful about which one you use.

97.1.1 OpenSSL not found: you need to create localconf.mk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZXID does NOT have a configure script. It ships with a notion
of "standard" locations for the three dependency libraries,
but if these libraries are not where it expects to find them,
then typically you see (n.b. lines were folded for presentation):

  make
  If you get compilation errors, try: make help
  gcc -g -fpic -fmessage-length=0 -Wno-unused-label -Wno-unknown-pragmas
     -fno-strict-aliasing -D_REENTRANT -DDEBUG -DUSE_CURL -DUSE_OPENSSL
     -DLINUX -I/tmp/zxid-0.20 -I/usr/local/ssl/include -I/usr/local/include
     -c -o zxid.o zxid.c
  zxid.c:34:23: curl/curl.h: No such file or directory
  In file included from zxid.c:38:
  zx.h:26:25: openssl/rsa.h: No such file or directory
  ...

What happened is that OpenSSL for some reason is not in the location
where standard OpenSSL distribution would install it (as indicated by
-I/usr/local/ssl/include flag that ships with ZXID Makefile). You need
to determine where OpenSSL is installed in your case. You can use

  find / -name rsa.h -ls

to locate candidates.

For example, if it turns out that OpenSSL is installed in /opt/ssl, then
you need to create a localconf.mk file that indicates this location:

  echo OPENSSL_ROOT=/opt/ssl >>localconf.mk

There are several other make variables you may need to tweak. In the
above example, we also notice that libcurl was not found where
expected. This would be fixed like this

  echo CURL_ROOT=/opt/curl >>localconf.mk

Net result? ZXID does not try to guess where the libraries are. It
makes you do the foot work of locating the correct libraries (some
people have more than one instance installed) and prepare the
localconf.mk. This may seem like a lot of work, but in my experience,
fixing GNU autohell configure scripts that guess wrong is thousand
times more frustrating. The system is dumb by design so you, as a human,
do not have to try to second guess it - you are in control.

97.1.2 Missing gperf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  gcc -g -fpic -fmessage-length=0 -Wno-unused-label -Wno-unknown-pragmas -fno-strict-aliasing -D_REENTRANT -DDEBUG -DUSE_CURL -DUSE_OPENSSL -DLINUX -I/c/cvs/zxid_cvs -I/usr/local/ssl/include -I/usr//include   -c -o c/zx-a-aux.o c/zx-a-aux.c
  c/zx-a-aux.c: In function "zx_NEW_a_Action":
  c/zx-a-aux.c:80: error: "zx_a_Action_ELEM" undeclared (first use in this function)

This happens because c/zx-const.h was misgenerated (it should not happen at
all if you do not supply ENA_GEN=1) and does not include the necessary defines.
c/zx-const.h should have more than 1900 lines and look something like

  /* generated file, do not edit! zx_ _ATTR */
  #ifndef _zx__ATTR
  #define _zx__ATTR
  #define zx_use_ATTR     0
  #define zx_used_ATTR    1

  ...
  #define zx_wantDSEPR_ATTR       347
  #define zx_ZX_TOK_NOT_FOUND_ATTR        348
  #define zx__ATTR_MAX    349
  #endif
  /* generated file, do not edit! zx_ _ELEM */
  #ifndef _zx__ELEM
  #define _zx__ELEM
  #define zx_ds_Y_ELEM    0

  #define zx_ZX_TOK_NOT_FOUND_ELEM        1630
  #define zx__ELEM_MAX    1631
  #endif

97.1.3 make samlmod gives "incompatible types in assignment"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should not happen with version 0.21 or later. See zxidnoswig.h
for explanation of the problem.

97.1.4 Perl compiled with different compiler than zxid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** this section also appears in zxid-perl.pd)

Perl modules generally want to be compiled with the same C compiler
and options as were used to compile perl itself (see perl -V). If this
happens to be different than the compiler you have defined in CC
variable (gcc by default, near top of Makefile or in localconf.mk), you may
get an error like:

  cd Net; perl Makefile.PL && make
  Warning: -L.. changed to -L/home/sampo/zxid/Net/..
  Writing Makefile for Net::SAML
  make[1]: Entering directory `/home/sampo/zxid/Net'
  cc -c  -I.. -I/apps/openssl/std/include -I/apps/include -D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DTHREADS_HAVE_PIDS -DDEBUGGING -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -Wdeclaration-after-statement -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -O2 -march=i586 -mtune=i686 -fmessage-length=0 -Wall -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -Wall -pipe   -DVERSION=\"\" -DXS_VERSION=\"\" -fPIC "-I/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i586-linux-thread-multi/CORE"   SAML_wrap.c
  /bin/sh: cc: command not found
  make[1]: *** [SAML_wrap.o] Error 127
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/zxid/Net'
  make: *** [samlmod] Error 2

*Solutions*

1. Compile zxid with compiler that was used for perl, e.g.

     make CC=the-compiler-that-perl-wants

2. Recompile perl using the compiler that you want to use for zxid

3. Tinker with PATH environment variable so that both C compilers
   are found. However, using two different compilers is not really supported.

In general these types of problems happen when you use perl installed
by your distribution, but have later compiled a gcc of your own. It may
even be that you never installed the distribution cc - in that case
consider installing it and then trying approaches 1 or 3.

A similar situation can arise with incompatibility of the compiler and
options used for dependency libraries, such as OpenSSL or libcurl, and
those used for compiling zxid itself.

97.1.5 All files under zx missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** this section also appears in zxid-java.pd and zxid-perl.pd)

You need to symlink zx to zxid source directory, thus

  ln -s . zx

If you do not have it, then you will get a lot of file inclusion errors for
headers that are supposed to be in path starting by zx/

The symlink is there to keep all hand written source files on top
level of directory for ease of development, yet allow inclusions to go
through ~zx~ subdirectory. When zxid is installed, it goes to
/usr/include/zx. Hence the symlink keeps the includes the same whether
developing or using installed version.

97.1.6 Compiler Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** this section also appears in zxid-java.pd and zxid-perl.pd)

If you compile zxid with compiler warnings turned on (CFLAGS += -Wall),
you will see quite a number of warnings, most of which are
unwarranted. Since the warnings are unwarranted, I ship zxid Makefile
with warnings turned off. If this bothers you, feel free to investigate
the warnings and report to me any issues you uncover.

Following warnings in partuclar are unwarranted:

1. Any unusued variable warnings, especially in generated code. Most
   common of these is ~se~ variable (see enc-templ.c).
2. "Suggest parenthesis around assignment when used as truth value." I
   rely on C language operator precedence. Also, in most cases the
   assignment is the only expression in the truth test - there simply
   is no opportunity for ambiguity -- and no justified case for gcc to
   warn about this.
3. "Suggest parenthesis around && when used in ||". I rely on C
   language operator precedence, hence the suggestion is redundant.

Some warnings you may want to worry about

A. "int format, long int arg". On 32 bit platforms int and long
   are both 32 bits so this warning is not an issue. On 64 bit platforms,
   however, there may be cause for worry.

97.1.7 SWIG and Java Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** this section also appears in zxid-java.pd)

97.2 Platform Specifics
-----------------------

If your Unix platform is not mentioned, you should try saying just

  make

which will compile with Linux options. These options actually
are pretty close to pure POSIX compile so you should get very close
to working configuration.

97.2.1 Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Native development platform. Just say

  make

Seems there are some "improvements" that distributions have made. ZXID
adopts the policy of expecting dependency modules where the module
author meant it to be installed by default - for example OpenSSL by
default installs in /usr/local/ssl (naming is historic, but has stuck).
Many distros tinker with these paths. This means you need to create
a localconf.mk.

Redhat used to have an issue with Net::SAML (make samlmod). This has
since been fixed, please see zxidnoswig.h for explanation.

No doubt, distros will eventually pick up ZXID and provide it as a package.
Once that happens they will solve any path issues accoring to their
disto policy and that is fine, just do not ask me to comply with any
such policy.

97.2.2 FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No target available on Makefile, but a port is available from
http://www.freshports.org/security/zxid/

97.2.3 Solaris (Sparc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  make TARGET=sol8
  make TARGET=xsol8    # Cross compile for Solaris (e.g. on Linux host)

97.2.4 MacOS X (PowerPC?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  make TARGET=macosx

97.2.5 Windows Using MinGW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  make zxid.dll TARGET=xmingw    # Cross compile on Linux host (best supported)
  make zxid.dll TARGET=mingw     # Native compile for mingw target in Cygwin environment

Either way, the net result is native Windows DLL that does not have
Cygwin library dependencies or GPL encumberation.

See Makefile for further mingw notes.

97.2.6 Windows Using Cygwin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  make TARGET=cygwin

Very experimental (as of Oct 2007) native build for Cygwin.

Cygwin appears to not have neither flock(2) nor lockf(2). This is
strange because at least one of these is implemented on MinGW.
Current workaround is to define flock() to be empty macro. This
of course means there is no file locking. There are 3 known races
where things can go wrong

1. Audit logs can get garbled. This does not stop ZXID from working,
   but may make log analysis more complicated.
2. Auto-CoT metadata writes can get garbled. This is very unprobable,
   but if it happens, the ZXID deployment will not work towards
   affected IdP. Nothing to worry about really.
3. Locking is used to protect against updates of zxid.conf while
   zxid is running. Again any corruption is very unlikely. Nothing
   to worry about.

The results of Cygwin compile may be GPL encumbered due to libraries.

97.2.7 Windows Using MSVC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Never been done (as of Oct 2007), but probably this is not very
difficult given that MinGW port already has addressed many Windows
platform issues. Please send any success reports, and receipes, my way.

As of June 2010 the MSVC support has improved. The sed dependency
was removed and any C language constructs that MSVC has indigestion with
have been removed. We are still aiming at Makefile based
build using Microsoft's cl compiler. You should try

  make TARGET=win32cl

If you manage to build it using some IDE project, please contribute
the project file. For ongoing maintenance, it would be good if the
project was a text file to which new source code files and be added
easily *without using the IDE*, i.e. using simple text editor.

97.3 Configuration Questions
----------------------------

(*** Some of these may be repeated in zxid-conf.pd)

1. Q: In mod_auth_saml, what is the relation between ZXIDConf and httpd.conf?

   A: httpd.conf can contain ZXIDConf directives. Those directives are
   processed as if they came from /var/zxid/zxid.conf file (which is
   processed first, before and ZXIDConf directives), except that if you
   specify ZXIDConf "PATH=/your/path", this triggers reporcessing of
   the zxid.conf (from the new path).

2. Q: In mod_auth_saml, what is the relation between the +port+ in ZXIDConf
   and the +port+ in the httpd.conf?

   A: The ports must agree. ZXID configuration must match the way the
   Apache layer is configured.

3. Q: Multiple roles of same entity, acting as SP, WSC, and WSP for
   different services

   Asa:
   > Part of what you are saying is that the service
   > registration is WSC.  This is rather confusing since the case is a WSP

   Conor:

   > (in fact, we don't define any such method of invocation as the invoking

   Right. You can don WSC role whenever convenient. There is nothing confusing
   about WSP of one service being WSC of another service. Perhaps the
   confusion would be avoided if everybody fully qualified their descriptions
   until common convention about less than fully qualified roles emerges.

   Entity E1, an ID-DAP WSP (primary role), will act as Discovery WSC
   (secondary role) to perform metadata registration. This same entity E1
   will also have SP interface (another secondary role) which allows
   the user to trigger discovery association, again E1 acting in secondary
   role of Discovery WSC.

   No confusion as far as I can see.

97.3.1 No certificates appear in metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: +I've been trying to set up ZXID's mod_auth_saml on an OS X server. The
EntityDescriptor XML doesn't seem to contain the public x.509 cert.+

A: The metadata (the URL ending in o=B) will not have certificates if
none actually were available. Thus visualizing the metadata in
a brower is a good way to check whether it is finding the certs. So
it is a feature ;-)

Q: +Does mod_auth_saml use the cert from /var/zxid/pem/ssl-nopw-cert.pem?+

A: The certs for metadata live in files

/var/zxid/pem/sign-nopw-cert.pem
/var/zxid/pem/enc-nopw-cert.pem

In more recent versions (current is 0.38, which version were you using?)
ZXID will automatically generate self signed certs if the certs are
not installed yet. However it may fail to write them to the filesystem
due to permissions problem. You should check that the user as which
Apache runs can indeed read from and write to /var/zxid/pem directory.

If you want to use officially issued certificates, you will of course
need to place them in the two files mentioned. Please note that the
files should be concatenation of certificate and the private key. Due
to this and the practise of not using password on the private keys
you should pay attention to protecting these files with filesystem
permissions - the caveat is that if you protect too well then
even the apache process can't read them. Recommended permissions are

  chown APACHEUSER /var/zxid/pem
  chmod -R 02750 /var/zxid/pem

where APACHEUSER is distribution dependent user account used to
run the apache process. You can do `ps axu | grep httpd' to see
what user apache runs as.

97.3.2 Skipping IdP Selection: Hardwiring the IdP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This in fact is possible. It is a bit convoluted (and not documented)
in that it effectively works by simulating submission of the
IdP selection screen, with the form fields and all. This is done
by setting DEFAULT_QS configuration option. For example, following

 ZXIDConf "DEFAULTQS=l0https://idp.tas3.eu/zxididp%25%33%66o%25%33%3dB=1%26fc=1%26fn=prstnt"

would simulate clicking login button for idp.tas3.eu. Note the URL
escaping that needs to be applied: %25%33%66 is decoded by the
configuration layer to mean "%3f", which is how at query string
layer the question mark needs to be escaped. The %26 means
ampersand that separates the arguments at querystring layer. It
is encoded only once. Hope this is not too confusing.

97.3.3 Web Service Provider Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The metadata is needed in the web service call mainly to know the
certificates. The endpoints in the metadata are ignored for purposes
of the web service call as the endpoint is supplied by the EPR.

Since SAML defines a metadata format with certificates (and SAML
relevant endpoints), the convention is that web service call consults
the SAML metadata for the certificates.

It is very common for same service to be accessible as a web GUI (SAML
SP) and web service (ID-WSF WSP), therefore it is considered
convenient for the SAML metadata to be used.

If the service does not want to be SAML SP and only wants to be ID-WSF
WSP, then it still needs to supply the SAML SP metadata just for the
purpose of the certificates (the SAML SP end point URLs will not be
used).

> My service only wants to be a ID-WSF WSP. For example, Custodix want
> to be able to call a SOA Gateway web service, and the SOA Gateawy
> knows nothing about SAML, etc.

> I need to ensure that ZXID will process necessary soap headers and
> accept or reject as appriorate.

You still need to generate metadata. Since your service does not have
SAML SP facet, you can't (directly) use o=B method (but see my example
zxidwspdemo.java how it still supports o=B). However you can just hand
edit a metadata file (perhaps using something from o=B as a template).

If you place the hand edited metadata in the right file on WSC side,
using

   .zxcot -a <meta.xml

then no dynamic metadata fetch will be attempted and you
do not need to support o=B.

See also zxid-idp.pd for registration of EPR and bootstrap.

97.4 API Questions
------------------

1. *Q*: What do I need to pass in as +enve+ argument to zxidjni.wsc_prepare_call()?

   *A*: zxidjni.wsc_prepare_call() has some auto detection. If you pass entire
   SOAP <e:Envelope>, then it will just add some headers. If you pass <e:Body>
   it will add <e:Envelope> and headers. If you pass anything else, it
   assumes that is meant to be content of the body and will add
   <e:Envelope><e:Headers>...</><e:Body>your stuff</></>

2. *Q*: What exactly is a "sha1 name"?

   *A*: Since ZXID (originally) uses filesystem as backend, a method
   for generating filesystem-safe strings, to be used as filenames,
   was needed. Further, there was occasionally requirement that each
   different file have different name. Solution to these problems
   is to hash the whatever part that is unique and use safe base64 [RFC3548]
   encoding of the hash as the filename.

   They are not very human friendly, but they are filesystem safe
   and unique as required. They are also constant width, which tends
   to make directory listing prettier, and also handles anomalously
   long Entity IDs gracefully.

   sha1 hashing is much less error prone than trying to escape or squash
   the various Entity IDs, Name IDs, and who-know-what to be filesystem
   safe. Add to the squasing  bugs, the convolutions of ensuring uniqueness
   and dealing with too long input and you should see why sha1 names are
   the most secure, easiest to implement, approach.

   See also sha1_safe_base64() in zxutil.c

97.4 Common Mistakes
--------------------

1.  When I try accessing https://sp1.zxidsp.org:8443/zxidtest.sh nothing happens!

    Assuming you have the web server correctly running, the most common
    gotcha is that zxidhlo has dynamic linking problem.
    See <<see: ZXID-Installing-CannedTutorialRunningZXIDasCGIundermini_httpd-AccessingZXID>>
    subsection "Dynamic Linking Problems", for explanation and resolution.

2.  Single Logout does not end the IdP session (i.e. IdP does
    not force you to supply password when you do SSO next time).

    Usual cause is that the management form (the one with the SLO buttons)
    does not have correct or any session ID. Do a view source on the
    the page and look for field called "s". The session ID is
    supposed to be extracted from the Single Sign-On result. For
    zxid_simple() you need to parse the returned LDIF and
    take the sesid. Pass that to zxid_fed_mgmt() as second argument.

3.  Login buttons do nothing.

    A possible cause is that the entity ID is not passed from
    the IdP selection form. If the form is using POST method,
    you must make sure you actually read the HTTP body and
    pass its contents to the zxid_simple() as the ~qs~ argument.

4.  The SP Login, a.k.a. IdP selection, page shows, but SSO does not work

    a. Your configuration does not match actual URL used to
       access the zxid system. For the zxidhlo family of
       examples you MUST edit the configuration string
       to match your situation. Watch out for domain name
       and port number.

    b. Connectivity issue prevents IdP from fetching metadata.
       Make sure your domain name is resolvable at IdP (e.g.
       add it to /etc/hosts). See also next point.

    c. IdP is not configured to get your metadata automatically.
       You have to configure your metadata to the IdP manually.
       How to do this depends on IdP product. Do not ask us.

    d. You supplied IdP URL that, in fact, is not the well known
       location for fetching IdP metadata. Or the IdP does
       not have well known location enabled. In the latter
       case you will need to install the IdP metadata
       manually (*** procedure to be documented). See [SAML2meta]
       section 4.1 "Publication and Resolution via Well-Known Location",
       p.29, for normative description of this method.

    e. Connectivity issue at web browser level. Make sure your
       web browser can resolve both SP and IdP domain names.
       Edit /etc/hosts as needed on the machine where the browser runs.

    f. Personal firewall blocks access. Check firewall set up on
       * browser machine
       * SP machine
       * IdP machine

5.  The SP Login, a.k.a. IdP selection, page does not show at all

    a. Connectivity issue at web browser level. Make sure your
       web browser can resolve both SP and IdP domain names.
       Edit /etc/hosts as needed.

    b. Personal firewall blocks access. Check firewall set up on
       * browser machine
       * SP machine

    c. You deployed the zxid in some other URL than you thought.
       Double check your webserver or servlet container
       configuration and be sure you understand where
       zxid is supposed to appear. Be sure you are editing
       the right configuration - some people run multiple
       web servers in their machine and get confused about
       which one actually is active on which port and where
       the configuration files are located.

    d. ZXID lacks execute permissions, dynamic link libraries
       are missing (use "ldd zxid" to check), or CGI permission
       setup prevents it from running. See previous bullet.

6.  Mystery configuration problems. Double check /var/zxid/zxid.conf
    or consider removing it if you do not understand what it does.
    Double check the conf string if using zxid_simple() interface.

7.  Writes a user...

    > Once it has been compiled, I copied the files zxidhlo.php and zxid.php
    > to /var/www/zxid (my webroot). I accessed zxidhlo.php?o=E with my browser
    > and I saw a page asking for IDP metadata. But when I looked at
    > the /var/log/apache2/error.log, I found these:

    >    sha1_name(cot) open (vopen_fd_from_path): No such file or directory 

    Did you create the /var/zxid hierarchy (make dir) and make sure your
    web user (nobody?) has write permission to the ~log~ directory? Or did
    you configure it to use some other directory than /var/zxid?

8.  What is this /var/zxidcot directory?

    It is supposed to be /var/zxid/cot

    When configuring PATH, did you forget trailing slash? E.g.

      "PATH=/var/zxid&URL=..."    # WRONG!
      "PATH=/var/zxid/&URL=..."   # Right

9.  If configuration appears to be prematurely truncated, then
    see if you need to adjust ZXID_MAX_CONF (default 4KB) in
    zxidconf.h and recompile.


10. *Q1:* I get rejection due to NotOnOrAfter or NotBefore. I think I have
    synchronized the clocks on IdP and SP. Log messages are

      t  zxidsso.c:466 zxid_validate_cond     zx d ssof: NotOnOrAfter ok. Time to expiry 21900 secs
      t  zxidsso.c:476 zxid_validate_cond     zx E ssof: NotBefore rejected with slop of 7300. Time to validity 21600 secs

    *A1:* This seems awful lot like a timezone issue. Slop is ZXID config
    parameter that defines the tolerance. I recently reduced it from 1 day
    to 3 hours because I got feeback that it was security issue to have
    such overbroad tolerance (which it is, but 1 day slop allows people
    with bad time zone configs to still have initial success - may be
    I go back to one day).

    On both IdP and SP, run

      TZ=GMT date

    and see if that is about 6 hour difference. I stronly suspect other
    machine being correctly on GMT (which does not even have concept
    of summer time that causes so much productivity losss :-) and other
    is on something like US Central time (your guess if summer time error applies).

    You can synchronize using

      TZ=GMT ntpdate ntp1.funet.fi

    (there may be server closer to you than Finland)

    *Q2:* I double checked the clocks, the SP and IdP are very close to our NTP
    server, within 100ms or so.  Why would it say there's a slop of 7300
    seconds?

    *A2:* Slop is just tolerance. The real problem is "Time to validity 21600 secs".
    If you can't get the clocks to synchronize, you can increase
    the config option BEFORE_SLOP=22000 in /var/zxid/zxid.conf. This
    of course has some security implications.

    *Q3:* My time zone is set to CDT on both machines. Is it possible that
    Shibboleth is using GMT and zxid is using my local time?  (Or the
    other way around)   21600 seconds seems too obvious to
    be a real clock skew.  If both systems have the same locale settings, then
    something in software must be choosing the wrong time zone.

    I set TIMEOUT_FATAL=0 and it does work.  I get my nid and my login session
    is working!  So, major hurtle accomplished, but I think I'd like to get to
    the bottom of this and find out what the real problem is.

    *A3:* 21600 seems very obvious timezone issue.

    On Unix the timezone behavior of a process is determined by setting
    of TZ environment variable. To my best knowledge I always use gmtime(3)
    which to my best understanding ignores the TZ environment variable.
    However, it is possible that I errornously or the Shib IdP use
    localtime(3), which will take TZ in account. Therefore I recommend
    launching all processes with environment TZ=GMT (see the date
    example above).

97.5 Consent
------------

A frequent concern among the business people and lawyer types is
whether the architecture provides for consent by the user. Usually
this is related to (avoidance of) liability. If the system can be
said to have gathered the consent of the user, we are safe.

Unfortunately the standards do not mandate an uniform user interface,
thus there is no single specific way how the consent is gathered or
determined: it depends from business situation and application to
another. Fortunately the Liberty and SAML 2.0 architectures provide
plenty of ways and hooks to gather and convey the consent. Consider the
following:

1. When arriving to SP, user chooses IdP for SSO. This act
   of course manifests user's intent to perform SSO.

2. IdP can ask the user whether he wants to perform SSO to
   the SP (IdP can make this question even if user is already
   logged in to the IdP, though most demos omit the question
   in the already logged in case).

   At this point the IdP may also ask whether the user
   wants to create a federation so that the SP can track
   the user. Creating federation is consenting to be
   tracked by the SP.

   If the federation already exists, the IdP can still
   offer a choice: should the federation be used
   this time, i.e. does the user consent to be tracked
   this time specifically.

   If user does not consent to federation and use of
   federation this time, but still consents to SSO,
   the SSO will be made using a temporary name ID.

3. If user gives any Personally Identifying Information
   to the SP (beyond the federated pseudonym), then
   the SP may be able to "connect the dots" and
   correlate user's actions on the SP with his actions
   in some other systems (technically this is called
   collusion).

   In a very technical sense users should be aware
   of this risk or the implication and therefore by
   providing such information they are effectively
   consenting to be correlated across systems.

   However, lawyers would probably say that if
   the SP intends to correlate, it should state
   so to the user at the time the information is
   asked so that the user can make an informed decision.
   If, after being informed, the user still supplies
   the information, then user is clearly
   consenting to the information being used for
   the stated purpose, i.e. correlation.

4. When user starts to use an ID web service, the user is
   consenting to this service being visible to at least
   some parties (why use the service if you did not
   intend this).

   To make this consent explicit, the user interface
   of the ID Web Service can ask.

   Also, the Discovery Service can ask consent using
   the Liberty Interaction Service. It is quite
   appropriate for the DS to ask this consent
   because it allows the ACL to be set correctly
   right from the beginning, when the service is
   registered.

5. When the user later accesses an SP that needs to
   contact an ID Web Service, it could be
   construed that the user, by using the SP
   at all, is effectively consenting that the SP
   may access the ID Web Services of the user.

   If this is not enough, the Discovery Service
   can use the Interaction Service on per service
   invocation basis to ask if the user consents
   to the specific request.

   Finally, the actual ID Web Service can also
   invoke the Interaction Service to ask the
   user to consent to the specific request,
   or otherwise enforce its policies.

6. When using People Service, the inviter (Alice)
   consents to the access by the invitee (Bob)
   by requesting an invitation string from the
   system.

   Once the invitation has been sent (and
   accepted by invitee) there is no easy way
   to collect consent from inviter on per
   request basis. For example Alice may not
   be online at the time when Bob accesses
   her resource.

   Alice can later revoke Bob's invitation,
   but in the window between Alice sending
   the invite and revoking it, Bob can access
   Alice's resource without Alice actively
   consenting to every access.

   Of course the resource can implement ACL
   policies, like only allowing Bob to access
   the resource a limited number of times,
   such as once.

7. When the invitee (Bob) uses inviter's (Alice's)
   ID Web Services (resources), Bob has
   consented to some form of tracking by
   Alice's resources by accepting the
   invite. Further consent may be obtained
   by Bob's own IdP, see bullet 2.

97.6 Deployment Planning
------------------------

Here is a rudimentary decision tree for deployment planning

1. List your applications
   a. Any provided by external partner?
   b. Non web apps
2. Document your existing identity stores and approaches to
   a. User provisioning (when someone is employed)
   b. Application provisioning (when someone starts using app)
   c. Authorization: how do you know who is supposed to be
      doing what?
   d. Deprovisioning: what happens when someone is fired?
   e. Login? Per app? Harmonized user names? Enterprise SSO?
3. Document your goal: federated SAML SSO über alles :-)
   a. Do you want to run IdP?
   b. Could you out-source IdP?
   c. Will your partners / customers be running their own IdPs?
   d. Will you participate (or run) single CoT or do you
      need to consider cross CoT inter-operation (e.g. IdP proxying)

To be continued...

97.7 Use of Signing and Crypto, Security Concerns
-------------------------------------------------

97.7.1 How is mod_auth_saml better than HTTP Basic Auth that it claims to emulate? HTTP Basic Auth does not address transport encryption. Is mod_auth_saml HTTP Basic Auth emulation vulnearable due to this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> I have looked at HTTP basic auth and it does not provide any
> transport level security, is it secure to use HTTP basic auth with
> certificates? is it common to do it that way?

HTTP-Basic is a method for authenticating a user using username and
password. This is orthogonal to whether the connection is encrypted.
Most common current practise is to combine HTTP-Basic-Auth with TLS (SSL)
encryption. This is considered safe, to the extent that passwords
can ever be safe. mod_auth_saml keeps the TLS encryption part intact,
but improves on the password insecurity part by either allowing
nonpassword authentication, such as Yubikey token, or at least allowing
one password disclosed to only one party (the IdP), rather than multiple
passwords at multiple parties (the weakness of the latter approach
is that the users tend to use the same passwords at the multiple
parties, allowing each party to impersonate the user at the other
party - and then there is the guessable password vulnearability).


97.8 Audit Trail
----------------

1. How can I see what attributes the single sign on assertion contains?

   From IdP side (assuming zxididp, for other IdPs consult respective documentation):

   a.  Locate the SSOA7N line from IdP activity log, e.g.

         grep SSOA7N /var/zxid/log/act

       which might return (single line, linewrap is only for this document)

         PP - 20100112-144157.750 20100112-144157.750 127.0.0.1:- \
         9u_7LsQjkz0VaXKucmx1_sYjQnM - AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW ENC \
         zxidp U K SSOA7N - -

   b.  The 8th field is the assertion ID, here AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW. With
       A7N ID you can grep the issued assertions, e.g.

         grep -l AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW /var/zxid/idplog/issue/*/a7n/*

       which might return something like

         /var/zxid/idplog/issue/9u_7LsQjkz0VaXKucmx1_sYjQnM/a7n/MxevnQGqKFwyBTPUZ-hI7m1PR-Q

       This file contains the assertion in plain text. You can inspect it to
       see what NameID is sent and what attributes are sent. One convenient command is

         grep -l AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW /var/zxid/idplog/issue/*/a7n/* \
            | xargs cat | ./xml-pretty.pl

   From SP side the steps would be

   i.  Locate FEDSSO line

         grep SSOA7N /var/zxid/log/act

       which might return (single line, linewrap is only for this document)

         PP - 20100112-144639.184 20100112-144157.501 -:- \
         xsKJr3DL7sUPDdbdqgC2H_eP-UM - AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW \
         FIrFwFdR4wO2UFLQZl8c3LlUW      zx O K FEDSSO MSES6GOG4ta-nQdYlRVJriv24dj8 -

   ii. The 8th field is the assertion ID. To locate the assertion in the rely
       audit trail of the SP you can grep as follows:

         grep -l AWTILy8_0yre96om7n4H-4fMW /var/zxid/log/rely/*/a7n/* \
            | xargs cat | ./xml-pretty.pl

97.9 Vendor products
--------------------

97.9.1 Symlabs Federated Identity Suite (SFIS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interoperates. SP and IdP.

Metadata import to IdP?

What I usually do is

  cd /opt/SYMfiam/3.0.x/conf/symdemo-idpa
  echo 'sp: zxid-sp1$https://sp1.zxidsp.org:8443/zxid?o=B$$' >>cot.ldif

Double check with text editor that the file is sensible.
Note that the single quotes are essential as the dollars
are to be interpretted literally, as separators.

  cd pem
  wget https://sp1.zxidsp.org:8443/zxid?o=B >zxid-sp1.xml

Here the intent is to fetch the metadata from the SP and
store it in a file whose name (without .xml extension)
matches the first component of the sp: line. I am not
100% on the wget syntax. You can also use browser
to fetch the metadata and simply Save as under the
correct name.

  cd /opt/SYMfiam/3.0.x/conf/symdemo-idpa/start.sh restart

This should restart the IdP server process and cause a
refresh of the metadata it may have cached. You may
want to

  tail -f /opt/SYMfiam/3.0.x/conf/symdemo-idpa/log/debug.log

to see if its getting indigestion.

N.B. FIAM seems to have NameID encryption on by default, Turn
this off by editing slimidp.ldif:

  encnids: 0

If this is not done, the SSO will fail (with what appears like signature
error).1x

97.9.2 Shibboleth and OpenSAML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shibboleth 2.1.5 IdP interoperates since 0.65. Earlier versions
interoperated in some configurations.

Many Shibboleth SPs interoperate (exact version numbers lost).

97.9.3 Lasso and Authentic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to work, may be still does. Not tested in recent memory.

97.9.4 OpenSSO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to work, may be still does. Not tested in recent memory.

97.9.5 simpleSAMLphp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interoperates, but as of Sept 2010, simpleSAMLphp IdP has problems with
EncryptedAssertions. Nothing ZXID can do (but you can turn off the
encryption if you are willing to assume the consequences).

simpleSAMLphp SP works.

97.9.6 Ping
~~~~~~~~~~~

Not tested in recent memory.

97.9.7 SiteMinder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CRLF emitting. Works since 0.65.

97.9.8 Bouncing Castle vs. OpenSSL Padding Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a XML ENC padding problem between OpenSSL and Bouncing Castle
Java Crypto Library. See OpenSSL bug number 1067:
http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&;pass=guest&id=1067

<<logoutput:

From: 	sampo@symlabs.com
To: 	rt@openssl.org, xml-encryption@w3.org

Subject: 	OpenSSL symmetric crypto padding check incompatible with XMLENC
Date: 	Thu, 12 May 2005 20:22:50 +0000

Please find below a patch, with spec reference, against OpenSSL 0.9.7g.

It could be argued that XMLENC spec is wrong in insisting on unpredictable
values for the padding because this allows padding to be used as a
covert channel. However, to deploy interoperable implementations it seems
patching OpenSSL is the right thing to do. It has been observed that
other crypto libraries, such as bouncing castle (a pure Java
implementation) do not set all padding bytes to OpenSSL's satisfaction.

-----------

OpenSSL is complying with various other standards with its current
behaviour. For example PKCS#7.

If the EVP functions are being called directly (instead of inside
OpenSSL in its PKCS#7 code for example) you can disable the padding
altogether EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() and perfom padding and pad
checking at an application level.

Steve.

Since ZXID version 0.65 (Oct 2010), this has been addressed via
the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding() route.

97.10 Known Bugs
----------------

Following are known limitations. We document them here
because we do not plan to fix them in foreseeable future.

1. Unknown XML attributes are not sorted according to rules
   of exc-c14n. Instead they appear always +after+ known
   XML attributes and in the order they happen to be
   in the linked list.

   *Work around:* Add the attribute to schema (.sg) and
   regenerate and rebuild.

2. Namespace qualified XML attributes have underscore instead of colon

97.11 Mysterious Error Messages
-------------------------------

"Random number generator not seeded!!!"

This warning indicates that randomize() was not able to read
/dev/random or /dev/urandom, possibly because your system does not
have them or they are differently named. You can still use SSL, but
the encryption will not be as strong. Investigate setting up
EGD (entropy gathering daemon) or PRNG (Pseudo Random Number
Generator). Both are available on the net.

"msg 123: 1 - error:140770F8:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown proto"

SSLeay error string. First number (123) is PID, second number (1) indicates
the position of the error message in SSLeay error stack. You often see
a pile of these messages as errors cascade.

"msg 123: 1 - error:02001002::lib(2) :func(1) :reason(2)"

The same as above, but you didn't call load_error_strings() so SSLeay
couldn't verbosely explain the error. You can still find out what it
means with this command:

     /usr/local/ssl/bin/ssleay errstr 02001002

97.11.1 snprintf() multibyte character related errors in log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is due to locale setting. Try

  export LANG=C

This will disable any UTF-8 processing in sprintf().

BTW, Win32 native _snprintf() on does not nul terminate if buffer is
full. Gotcha! All zxid code has additional manual nul termination,
just in case.

97.11.2 My own messages are redirected back to me
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In several SAML profiles a HTTP redirect is performed to
send the user to other party, usually with a request or
response in the query string.

A mysterious error is when you see yourself receiving
as input the stuff that was supposed to be sent to the
other. The way this happens is if for some reason the
other party's URL can not be determined, then the
Location header will only consist of the query string
that you are trying to send. Without domain name part
of the URL, the browser will redirect back to the
web site where the redirection came from. This is
called "local redirect" and is usually the cause
of you receiving your own output as input.

To fix this, make sure you have the other site's metadata
and make sure it parses and loads correctly. If that
does not resolve the problem, see if the metadata
has any binding for the operation you are trying.
No binding will result in no URL.

97.12 Certificates and Private Keys
-----------------------------------

97.12.1 Password is being asked for private key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is normal behaviour if your private key is encrypted. Either
you have to supply the password or you have to use unencrypted
private key.

One way to remove password is

  openssl rsa -in key.pem -out keyout-nopw.pem

For this to work, key.pem must have only the provate key. On the other
hand, for ZXID to work, the file must have both certificate and
private key. You will need to use your favorite text editor to
accomplish this.

Scan OpenSSL.org for the FAQ for full explanation on how to
remove password from the private key.

97.12.2 Quick command for looking at certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** also appears in zxid-cot.pd)

Sometimes you get warning messages (in browser) or signature
validation errors (in IdP end) because the Subject field of the
certificate does not match your actual domain name. You can
check this with

  openssl x509 -text </var/zxid/pem/ssl-nopw-cert.pem | grep Subject:

If the domain name is different, then you need to obtain a certificate
with correct domain name, see next question.

97.12.3 Self signed certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(*** also appears in zxid-cot.pd)

ZXID ships with zxid.pem which gets by default copied to /var/zxid/pem
under various different names. This is fine for testing, but disastrous
for production or security sentitive use as the private key corresponding
to zxid.pem certificate is of public knowledge (it is distributed with
every copy of ZXID) - it offers no security and no non-repudiation
what-so-ever.

For production or security sensitive install you need to either

1. Obtain certificates from an official certification authority,
   usually a commercial one. ZXID uses same certificate format as
   Apache (i.e. the pem format), so aquiring certificates is easi. Or,

2. Generate your own certificate. The simplest case is a self signed
   certificate:

     openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -keyout pkey.pem -out cert.pem
     cat cert.pem pkey.pem >/var/zxid/pem/ssl-nopw-cert.pem

The cat step is there because you need to supply both certificate
and the private key in same file for ZXID to understand it.

> Warning: Although ZXID wants to see the private key in the same

97.12.4 Installing CA Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some versions of libcurl apparently do not respect setting
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST to 0 and thus require a CA certificate to be
trusted. This may result SSL connection error messages like

  CURLcode(35) CURLerr(SSL connect error)

See: http://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/others.shtml#ca-openssl

To fix this

1.  Determine what is your OpenSSL library's directory ("OPENSSLDIR")

      strace -e file openssl version 2>&1 | grep openssl.cnf

    may result

     open("/apps/openssl/0.9.8g/ssl/openssl.cnf", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3

    Here the /apps/openssl/0.9.8g/ssl/ is the ~OPENSSLDIR~.

2.  Download from the certificate authority their certificate
    in PEM format ("Apache" format) and save it in OPENSSLDIR/cert.pem


3.  Check

      openssl verify -CApath OPENSSLDIR/certs/ OPENSSLDIR/cert.pem

    which should in successful case print

      /apps/openssl/0.9.8g/ssl/certs/the_ca.pem: OK

    If the hash is not right, it will print something like

      /apps/openssl/0.9.8g/ssl/certs/the_ca.pem: /C=US/O=TheCA/OU=TheCA
      error 18 at 0 depth lookup:self signed certificate
      OK

4.  Alternative approach using certs/ directory with hashes. Save the
    certificate under OPENSSLDIR/certs with any name (say, the_ca.pem)

5.  Create a hash

      cd OPENSSLDIR
      ln -s the_ca.pem `openssl x509 -hash -noout -in the_ca.pem`.0

6.  Check: see step 3, substituting cert.pem with the_ca.pem.

97.13 Author's Pet Peeves
-------------------------

1. What is Schema Grammar (.sg) and why are you using it?
   * Schema Grammar is a compact formal description of XML documents. It is
     mostly bidirectionally convertible to XML Schema (XSD) and captures
     the useful essence of most XML schemata.
   * Schema Grammars are intuitive and compact, often allowing the
     essence to be understood at glance, and even most complex cases
     being only about 50% of the volume of the corresponding XSD.
   * We use Schema Grammar descriptions because they are more human readable
     than XSD and still equally amenable to automated code generation.
   * Schema Grammar descriptions are usually converted using xsd2sg.pl, which is
     part of the PlainDoc distribution.
   * See http://mercnet.pt/plaindoc
   * N.B. You do not need xsd2sg.pl or PlainDoc if you just want to compile and use ZXID.

2. What is PlainDoc (.pd)?
   * PlainDoc is a document preparation system that uses intuitive plain text files
     with minimal markup to generate PDF and HTML outputs.
   * We use PlainDoc because it makes it easy to maintain documentation.
   * See http://mercnet.pt/plaindoc
   * N.B. You do not need PlainDoc if you just want to compile and use ZXID.

3. How come zxid is so heavy to compile?
   * SAML 2.0 and related specs have a lot of functionality and detail, even
     if you really only need 1% of it. We do not wish to arbitrate which
     functionality is best or most needed, so we simply provide it all.
   * A lot of the code is generated, thus the input for C compiler is well
     in excess of half a million lines of code (of which only about 6k
     were written by a human).
   * Some of the generated files are gigantic, e.g. Net/SAML/zxid_wrap.c
     is over 380k lines. Compiler has to process all of this as a single
     compilation unit.
   * gcc and gnu ld were, perhaps, not designed to process this large inputs
     efficiently. Often the implementation strategy of keeping
     everything in memory will cause a smaller machines to swap.
   * My 1GHz CPU, 256 MB RAM machine definitely swaps and thus
     takes about 45 minutes to compile all this stuff.
   * I recommend at least 1GB RAM and 3GHz CPU for development
     machine. On such machine, you should be able to build in about 10 min.

4. Why do you not use ./configure and GNU autoconf?
   * ~autoconf~ is not for everyone. World does not stop without
     ~autoconf~. Or indeed need ~autoconf~. It is Yet Another Dependency
     I Do Not Need (YADIDNN).
   * I find the GNU ~autoconf~ stuff much more difficult to understand than
     my own ~Makefile~. Why should I debug ~autoconf~ when I could
     spend the time debugging my ~Makefile~ or the actual code?
   * I find resolving problems much easier at source code and ~Makefile~ level
     than trying to debug a million line script generated by some system
     I do not understand (perhaps some hardcore ~autoconf~ advocate could
     try to convince me and educate me, but I doubt).
   * My policy is to only support systems I have first hand experience with,
     or I have trustworthy friends to rely on. It does not help me
     to have a system that tries to guess +gazillion irrelevant variables+
     to an unpredictable state. It's much easier to stick to standards like
     POSIX and make sure you have predictable results from predictable inputs.
   * If the deterministic and predictable results are wrong, they can
     at least be debugged and fixed with a finite amount of work.
   * Supporting all relevant systems manually is not that much of work. The
     inhabitants of the irrelevant systems can support themselves, probably
     learning a great deal on the side.

97.13.1 What does ZXID aim at - an answer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A recent (Sept 2006) conversation that touched on the aims of ZXID project:

> So just generally, what are your goals for it, are you interested in making
> it work well with what other people are producing (e.g. SAML -> WSF
> cross-over), etc? I'm certainly assuming the answer's yes to that.

I aim at full stack client side implementation. ID-FF, SAML 2.0, WSF
(both versions). The generation technique I use will yield the
encoders and decoders for both WSP and WSC, but the hand written
higher level logic will at first be only written for SP and WSC. 
Some WSP support has now been written as well (complete WSP support
was completed as of July 2007).

It is Apache licensed project, of course, so if someone contributes
the IdP and WSP capabilities, I'll merge them into the distribution.

I am interested to have it working with other people's code at 3 levels:

1. Over-the-wire interoperability
2. I have split the functionality of the SP from the WSC such that
   zxid SP could probably be used with someone else's WSC and someone
   else's SP would reasonably easily be able to use zxid WSC.
3. Interfaces to non IdM parts of the complete system, typically
   used to implement the application layer, shall be
   plentiful: C/C++ API, Net::SAML/mod_perl, php - whatever you
   can SWIGify.

One thing I am NOT interested in is "layered" stack. I strongly
believe it's better each vertically integrated slice is implemented by
one mind. Thus, except for lowest HTTP, TLS, and TCP/IP layers, my SP,
or WSC, or WSP, handles the whole depth of the stack - SOAP,
signature, and app interface layers (of course the actual app should
be its own layer and probably user written). That is by design.

I have found in practise that if you attempt a layered stack, you have
impedance mismatches between the modules at different layers because
they were designed and written by different minds. By having vertical
integration I avoid impedance mismatches. This is the reason why
monolithic TCP/IP implementations tend to be better than explicitly
layered, such as the streams approach.

Now, if someone else wanted to take my generated encoders and
decoders and use them as a "layer" in their layered stack, I guess
I would not have any issue. If you do that, please let me know
because I would have to commit to API stability at that layer.
I am willing to do that once there are real projects that depend
on it, but until then I still may redesign those APIs, after
all, I am at revision 0.4 :-)

In the end, it seems that ZXID is actually somewhat layered approach -
what I mean by "vertical integration" is that all the layers are
designed and controlled by the same mind.

> BTW, I gather that it's SAML 2.0 at the moment, which I can't offer any test
> capability for, but if you get to SAML 1.1, I'm happy to set up some kind of

In SSO world SAML 1.1 and ID-FF 1.2 capabilities are definitely on the
road map. In ID-WSF world, I'll probably start with 2.0 DS-WSC (don't
we all) followed by ID-DAP WSC and then tackle 1.1 after
that.<<footnote: As of version 0.18, July 2007, both WSC and WSP roles
of ID-DAP as well as ID-HR-XML have been implemented. Discovery client
was implemented as well. This means the generic WSC and WSP support is
there.>>

97.13.2 Annoyances and improvement ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a lot of commonality that is not leveraged, especially in the
way service end points are chosen given the metadata.  The descriptors
are nearly identical so casting them to one should work.

Many of the SAML2 responses are nearly identical. Rather than
construct them fully formally, we could have just one "SAML any
response" function. Perhaps this could be supported by some schema
grammar level aliasing feature: if an element derives from base type
without adding anything at all of its own, we might as well only
generate code for the base type.

Namespace aliasing scheme would allow us to consider two versions of
schema the same. It seems to be fairly common that the schema
changes are so minor that there is no justification for two
different decoding engines.

97.13.3 Non-obvious SAML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Destination XML attribute is needed in redirect and POST bindings.

2.  Assertion//SubjectConfirmationData/@InResponseTo XML attribute
    is needed in SSO assertions, unless the SSO was unsolicited.
    SAML is not very explicit about this, [SAML2core], ll.729-732
    describes it as optional, but [SAML2prof], ll.580-582 and
    ll.559-560 seem to imply this requirement.

3.  Some deployments use POST binding for many more things than
    officially sanctioned by SAML [SAML2conf], Table 1 "Possible
    Implementations", p.6. None of the offical profiles, see
    [SAML2conf], Table 2 "Feature Matrix", p.9, require support
    for POST for sending or receiving Single Logout or Manage NameID
    requests. Nor is sending AuthnRequest using POST officially
    sanctioned. Using artifact profile for anything else than
    fetching the SSO assertion is not official. Never-the-less,
    some of these bindings are perfectly implementable and some
    deployments actually use them. ZXID may support some of them,
    especially the POST bindings, if it is easy to do so, but
    we make no commitment beyound official SAML conformance.

4.  In SAML SOAP bindings it is bit unclear if the caller needs
    to be authenticated. Currently ZXID solves this by signing
    the SOAP requests (see SSO_SOAP_SIGN configuration options).
    Other approaches are using HTTP Basic authentication,
    using Client-TLS, or simply not authenticating the peer.

5.  Interpretation of metadata KeyDescriptor/EncryptionMethod

    Algos on [SAML2conf], section 4.2 "XML Encryption Algorithms",
    ll.252-253.

    The interpretation in [SAML2meta], section 2.4.1.1 "Element
    <KeyDescriptor>", ll.621-624, p.16, and the example
    on l.1117.

    Since the <EncryptionMethod> can appear several times, it
    would seem reasonable to specify it once for assymmetric crypto
    and once for symmetric crypto. If specified, then for each
    of the cases, only one of the allowed algos may be used.
    If not specified, then any algo authorized in [SAML2conf]
    is allowed. If specified, but the algo is not authorized
    by [SAML2conf], then implementation is nonconformant.

6.  The selection of protocol binding for return path of
    SSO is non-trivial. The Authentication Request may
    specify any number of parameters like ProtocolBinding
    or Index. Generally it should not be specified at
    all, leaving the decision to the IdP, or it should
    be specified using the Index method.

7.  When passing around Name IDs or storing them in database,
    remember to store all components, including NameQualifier
    and SPNameQualifier.

8.  Single Logout: IdP should not call originator of SLO when
    it is logging out everybody.

9.  SAML Redirect binding signs the base64 and URL encoded
    payload. This is problematic as there is no canonical
    way to URL encode, i.e. some implementations encode
    more than others. When signature needs to be verified,
    CGI or other layer of processing may already have
    removed the URL encoding, thus breaking the signature.
    Correct implementation requires capturing the URL encoded
    version of ~SAMLRequest~ or ~SAMLResponse~ field
    as it came from wire and using that for signature
    verification. This is what ZXID does, but historically
    some implementations have tried to URL reencode for
    signature verification, resulting "it depends" type
    bugs where sometimes it works when sender's URL
    encoding happens to match the URL encoding the receiver
    applies. Of course all of this could have been avoided
    had the design been to sign the base64 encoded form
    prior to URL encoding. And URL encoding would not
    have been needed at all if safebase64 ([RFC3548], sec 4)
    encoding had been used in the first place.

10. SAML SimpleSignPOST binding may superficially seem
    similar to Redirect binding in the signature area. Well,
    it is not. SimpleSign signs the payload data prior to
    base64 (and URL) encoding. This avoids the bug that
    easily creeps into Redirect signature verification,
    see above. Downside is that the payload can't really be
    binary, unless you base64 encode twice.

11. EncryptedAssertion and EncryptedID: how is the EncryptedKey
    found?

    a. The EncryptedData/KeyInfo/RetrievalMethod references the Id attribute of
       the EncryptedKey element, which is sister of the EncryptedData.
	Shibboleth 2010 can be kludged to work with this method if
	EncryptedKey element has Recipient XML attribute equal to the
        EntityID of the SP. This is nowhere well documented, but appears
        to work.

    b. EncryptedKey is child of EncryptedData/KeyInfo, i.e.
       EncryptedData/KeyInfo/EncryptedKey. Shibboleth SP appears to use
       this latter method as of 2010. Scott ackowledged method (a) as
       also valid and will fix Shibboleth SP.

    See saml-core-2.0-os.pdf, sec 2.2.4 Element <EncryptedID>, p.14, l.495
    specifies that EncryptedData and EncryptedKey are sister elements.
    See also ll.515-521 for schema fragment.
    Sec 2.3.4 Element <EncryptedAssertion> on p.17 contains similar language.
    as does 2.7.3.2 Element <EncryptedAttribute> on p.31.

[12:10:41] ? This is is what I sent on the wire.
[12:11:49] Oliver: ok let me make a diff and see if that is what i received
[12:13:30] sampo.kellomaki: If we analyze this you can see that EncryptedKey is sister element of EncryptedData element.
[12:14:48] Oliver: ok it is exactly identical to what i have in the log
[12:15:28] sampo.kellomaki: The KeyInfo of the EncryptedData references #EK39 and the EncryptedKey has Id attribute EK39
[12:15:43] ? That is the mechanism by which it is supposed to find the encrypted key.
[12:16:17] ? Now the next step is that EncryptedKey itself has KeyInfo that contains X509 certificate.
[12:16:45] ? That certificate is supposed to be your SP's encryption certificate, taken from your metadata.
[12:17:22] ? Do you follow me?
[12:17:41] Oliver: yes
[12:18:43] sampo.kellomaki: Now, at cursory inspection the cert in the message matches the cert in your metadata.
[12:19:01] ? Can you spot any error here?
[12:19:20] Oliver: let me do a diff to double check ... one sec
[12:19:56] sampo.kellomaki: Your metadata says you are using same certificate for encryption and signing.
[12:20:48] ? Next verification would be to see if your metadata matches the certificate actually used by SP at this step.
[12:22:25] ? I think the log messages that Scott provides are too terse to analyze this problem. Giving one blanket "Unable to locate an encrypted key" error message for all potential points of failure outlined thus far is not sufficient.
[12:23:15] ? I have to go eat now. I hope these ideas help. I'll be back in an hour.
[12:23:35] ? You do have credentials on zxidp.org so you can reproduce all this at will, right?

[13:54:23] Oliver: as you might have noticed ... i am not an saml expert ... so I don&apos;t really have a theory why it is not working
[13:54:57] ? the strange thing is that it seems to work fine with protectnetwork and the kantara idp

[13:55:52] Oliver: i am doing the system administration for kantara ... and very much interested in saml and learning more about it
[13:56:02] ? but still far from being an expert
[13:56:09] sampo.kellomaki: Can you capture the wire message from protect network?
[13:56:46] ? For example turn off JavaScript and perform the login. When it stops on the POST page, save that page so you can see what the IdP is sending to the SP.
[13:56:47] Oliver: sure let me login via protect network and capture it ... once sec
[13:57:29] ? i can see the wire message in the logs

[14:00:42] ? here is what i got from them
[14:01:25] sampo.kellomaki: THe assertion is not encrypted at all!
[14:02:01] ? That leaves them open to attacks by infected web browsers.
[14:02:19] ? The so called active intemediary man in the middle attack.
[14:02:55] ? Can you make similar verification to see if Kantara IdP encrypts the assertion?
[14:02:57] Oliver: oh you wanted the encrypted version?
[14:03:25] sampo.kellomaki: If encrypted version was passed on the wire, I want to see it.
[14:04:28] ? If https is used, the most reliable place to capture is stopthe POST flow just before the form with the assertion is posted to the SP. Give me the content of the SAMLResponse form field.

[14:16:05] ? Ok, I see the difference: I use EncryptedData/KeyInfo/RetrievalMethod to designate the EncryptedKey where as protectednet uses EncryptedData/KeyInfo/EncryptedKey
[14:16:24] ? Schemawise both appear valid and I support both in my SP.
[14:16:35] Oliver: ok
[14:17:08] sampo.kellomaki: Which code does protect-network use?

[14:17:59] ? i don&apos;t know what they use
[14:18:07] sampo.kellomaki: Yes, I think it is bug in shibboleth SP. It should accept either way of doing it.
[14:18:41] Oliver: ok so maybe we should forward that info to scott

[14:20:20] sampo.kellomaki: Meanwhile, I will add to my IdP an option to generate it the EncryptedData/KeyInfo/EncryptedKey way.
[14:20:37] ? Since the problem is with encryption, I want the encrypted version.

[14:23:22] sampo.kellomaki: Yes, I am looking at it...
[14:25:44] ? The encrytped-simplesamlphp.txt does not contain encrypted assertion (or ancrypted anything).
[14:26:14] ? If this really is what you captured from the POST SAMLResponse field, then your IdP is vulnearable to the MITM attack.
[14:30:30] ? You are using the POST binding in all cases, right?
[14:30:50] Oliver: yes
[14:30:56] ? one sec looking at the xml
[14:31:19] sampo.kellomaki: That is important because encrypting the assertion is not needed in artifact binding.
[14:32:38] Oliver: yes i see the encrypted is missing

[16:20:37] ? I have a hunch on this. I'll check the specs.
[16:20:46] Oliver: ok
[16:21:02] sampo.kellomaki: Is there any way I could just use http request to a CGI to obtain a tail of your log?
[16:21:51] Oliver: we don&apos;t have anything setup right now
[16:24:10] sampo.kellomaki: There may be a good policy reason why not to set up such log access, but if there is no rule against it, it would be pretty trivial php or perl CGI script to write.
[16:24:34] ? Think about that while I think about BearerConfirmation :-)
[16:25:56] Oliver: yes would not be too hard to write a little php for that but I would have to check with joni if she is ok with it
[16:26:28] ? i think there have a national holiday there today though

[17:01:58] sampo.kellomaki: It appears SP side session was created all right.
[17:02:20] ? I think we are now at the point where SAML is no longer involved. 
[17:02:24] Oliver: yes I still need to map some attributes but looks allright
[17:02:43] sampo.kellomaki: Where did that cookie%3A982a07ae come from?
[17:03:08] ? It appears that the equals sign got URI escaped and perhaps that is throwing it off?
[17:04:30] Oliver: is there maybe a ? missing?
[17:04:59] sampo.kellomaki: That could be, as well.
[17:05:50] ? Lets entertain the theory that cookie%3A982a07ae came from the RelayState field and investigate how it was passed in AuthnRequest and Response.
[17:08:52] Oliver: but then the same thing should happen with the protect network
[17:09:09] sampo.kellomaki: If you look at the original HTTP redirect that is made to convey AuthnRequest, you can see QueryString argument RelayState=cookie%3A8cd0ff4c
[17:10:11] ? So clearly your SP (or WAYF service?) already passes it in that format. As far as I have understood the protocol, I am not supposed to decode it (nor reencode).
[17:12:11] ? If I intercept a POST, I can see the field <input name="RelayState" value="cookie%3A982a07ae" type="hidden">
[17:13:04] ? Perhaps the field should have been <input name="RelayState" value="cookie=982a07ae" type="hidden">
[17:13:42] ? I.e. the RelayState gets encoded twice because the browser, when posting the form will encode again.
[17:14:13] Oliver: i think it needs to be a :
[17:14:37] ? this is what i am getting from protect network

[17:15:51] sampo.kellomaki: I'll try this and see if it fixes...
[17:17:29] Oliver: ok
[17:30:56] sampo.kellomaki: It went through!
[17:31:31] ? But I landed back on the Current Members page where I had started by clicking the Log In.
[17:31:51] ? The Log In still appears.
[17:32:00] Oliver: yes probably some attribute mapping missing hold on
[17:32:01] sampo.kellomaki: How do I know that I am logged in?
[17:32:33] ? Shouldn't Single Logout button of some sort appear (and Log In disappear)?
[17:32:53] Oliver: yes your username appears
[17:32:57] ? hold one one second
[17:33:05] ? need to logout and login to try it
[17:33:24] sampo.kellomaki: But how can I logout? I do not see any logout button?

[17:34:36] sampo.kellomaki: FYI, the page I am using for these tests: http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/GI/Current+Members
[17:35:22] ? Those attributes can be safely ignored for time being.
[17:35:34] Oliver: where do you pass the username?
[17:35:40] ? what attribute?
[17:35:48] ? and format?
[17:36:02] sampo.kellomaki: No attribute. I pass pseudonymous NameID.
[17:36:16] ? That appears in Subject element of the SAML assertion.
[17:36:47] ? In your log 2010-09-06 13:34:04 DEBUG Shibboleth.AttributeDecoder.NameID [28]: decoding NameIDAttribute (persistent-id) from SAML 2 NameID with Format (urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent)
[17:37:01] ? would appear to correspond to that.
[17:37:40] Oliver: ok so let me try to map NameID to our username
[17:38:28] sampo.kellomaki: But perhaps we need to take a step back at this point: assume a random user of zxidp.org wants to access kantara. How would kantara know that user (identified by persistent pseudonym) is in fact a user that is allowed to access Kantara?
[17:38:58] ? I vaguely recollect that last time I asked this question, the answer was that Kantara does not care.
[17:39:02] Oliver: all end up in the standard user group first
[17:39:22] ? where you see the same as if you were not logged in
[17:39:44] ? and then you contact staff and ask to be assigned to another group
[17:39:54] sampo.kellomaki: But you should see at least the logout button or some indication that you are logged in.
[17:40:43] Oliver: yes you see your username where it says login etc
[17:40:53] ? can edit your profile
[17:40:55] ? etc.
[17:41:12] sampo.kellomaki: "username"? Is that something Kantara assigns internally?
[17:42:01] Oliver: it is something like omaerz@protectnetwork.com
[17:42:30] sampo.kellomaki: Are you expecting the IdP to pass you that?
[17:42:40] Oliver: yes
[17:43:03] sampo.kellomaki: That looks like globally unique id, a correlation handle.
[17:43:05] Oliver: that is why i was looking at the attributes
[17:43:14] sampo.kellomaki: That  is privacy hostile.
[17:43:50] Oliver: that is the way the shibboleth plugin for confluence works
[17:44:19] sampo.kellomaki: Liberty Alliance spent 8 years engineering relationshipwise pseudonymous privacy friendly protocols and now you want global correlation handle.
[17:44:23] Oliver: we can map that username, name and email address if we get it from an idp
[17:44:39] ? i don&apos;t
[17:44:53] ? the people who implement the plugin do
[17:45:20] ? i was only asked to set that system up in that way
[17:45:41] sampo.kellomaki: Basically my IdP will give you persistent pseudonym. That allows you to keep your local database that knows some things about me.
[17:46:18] ? Towards some other SP the IdP will give a different pseudonym so that the other site can not correlate information with Kantara.
[17:46:27] ? This is very important for privacy.
[17:46:58] ? In the end it reduces to what is the minimum amount of information that Kantara needs to know about me.
[17:47:26] Oliver: ok
[17:47:30] sampo.kellomaki: Perhaps some email is needed, but I would hope to use different email at each SP.
[17:48:17] Oliver: email is optional and you can fill it in manually in confluence
[17:48:22] sampo.kellomaki: How tightly are the mailinglists integrated to the web site?
[17:48:22] Oliver: same with name
[17:48:38] ? no mailman integration
[17:49:02] sampo.kellomaki: Ok, so I can SSO with IdP and then selectively supply the pieces of information and the versions of those pieces just for Kantara.
[17:49:04] Oliver: do you know of a saml module for mailman?
[17:49:27] sampo.kellomaki: In that case, wouldn't it work well to just use the persistent pseudonym as username?
[17:49:32] Oliver: the only thing i need to get this to work is a username
[17:49:43] ? yes let me try
[17:49:53] ? what does that pseudonym look like?
[17:50:14] sampo.kellomaki: Base64 encoded 128bit random number.
[17:51:00] Oliver: i have to make sure they are unique ... so some other idp does not give us the same username
[17:51:09] ? i.e. you second ipd
[17:51:14] ? idp
[17:51:25] sampo.kellomaki: <sa:NameID xmlns:sa="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion" Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent" NameQualifier="https://zxidp.org/idp" SPNameQualifier="https://kantarainitiative.org/shibboleth-sp">FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz</sa:NameID>
[17:51:54] ? In this XML snippet you see NameQualifier.
[17:52:26] ? That is essentially the namespace inside which the 128bit thing (FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz) is unique.
[17:53:18] ? So to form your username, you could concatenate the two. You could even use @ character as a separator, but that still would not make it workable email.
[17:54:04] ? BTW, the SPNameQualifier for you is always same. But for IdP serving multiple SPs that also forms important part of the namespace.
[17:55:06] ? Another approach you could take is simply do a sha1 hash over the canonical serialization of the whole NameID element.
[17:55:20] ? and use that as username.
[17:56:13] ? When SAML was designed, the choice was to identify IdP by a URL rather than just domain name. This makes it difficult to construct any meaningful email address that would include IdP identification.
[17:56:36] ? You can talk to Scott about that. May be he remembers why this design was adopted.
[17:57:17] Oliver: hmm this is really ugly: https://zxidp.org/idp!https://kantarainitiative.org/shibboleth-sp!frsltg-zdkuvj-pes_miq44cz
[17:57:25] ? also this will break confluence
[17:57:57] sampo.kellomaki: That would be a bug in Confluence, IMNSHO.
[17:57:57] Oliver: like when click on a user to see his profile
[17:58:39] ? is it really such a big deal if you passed some unique identifier that looks more like an email address?
[17:59:00] ? i mean you could stick the id in there
[17:59:10] sampo.kellomaki: How about this: FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz@yBeCTPt0NQ2vMuI-srKw5h4N2i8
[17:59:12] Oliver: something like sp!frsltg-zdkuvj-pes_miq44cz@zxidp.org
[17:59:25] ? or that
[18:00:03] sampo.kellomaki: where  the FR stuff is the persistent pseudonym and the yBe stuff is safe_base64 encoded sha1 hash of https://zxidp.org/idp
[18:01:10] Oliver: sure
[18:01:11] sampo.kellomaki: Personally I would find  FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz@zxidp.org ok as long as you do not make any assumption that you can actually send mail there :-0
[18:01:21] Oliver: no
[18:01:28] ? it is not used as an email address
[18:01:50] ? the email address CAN be passed as an attribute but that is optional
[18:02:41] ? if it is passed then only to pre-populate the email field in confluence the very first time somebody logs in
[18:02:42] sampo.kellomaki: If you adopt that convention it would be really cool if you also documented it so that could become a widely adopted solution and convention to this problem in the confluence and even wider world.
[18:03:23] ? What attribute others are passing to you to pick the user name?
[18:03:31] Oliver: you mean the  FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz type usernames?
[18:03:51] sampo.kellomaki: Does anyone else try to pass you persistent pseudonym?
[18:04:14] Oliver: protectnetwork is passing &lt;protectnetwork username&gt;@protectnetwork.com
[18:04:37] ? kantara idp is passing the username without the @... at the then
[18:04:52] ? end
[18:04:54] sampo.kellomaki: I guess what I am saying that if there is some industry convention (that I do not know about), I could pass the pseudonym the same way.
[18:05:17] ? So for kantaraidp you need to add the @idp.ki
[18:05:20] ? ?
[18:05:36] Oliver: i guess i could add it
[18:05:50] sampo.kellomaki: What is the name of the attribute protectnetwork uses to pass this?
[18:06:04] Oliver: hold on let me look it up
[18:06:24] ? http://www.protectnetwork.org/support/policies/attribute-release-policy
[18:06:38] ? we do not user firstname lastname though
[18:06:58] ? as the confluence plugin expects the whole name in one field
[18:07:46] ? so urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6 is what we use for the username
[18:08:00] ? they do not pass the email
[18:08:02] ? to us
[18:08:38] sampo.kellomaki: That is, urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:eduPersonPrincipalName .
[18:09:46] Oliver: but they do not pass it to us
[18:09:53] ? for whatever reason
[18:10:00] ? they pass it to others
[18:10:24] sampo.kellomaki: In urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6 they the pass the email like thing.
[18:10:43] Oliver: yes
[18:11:06] sampo.kellomaki: So they do not pass email attribute, but pass in eduPersonPrincipalName something that most of the time is the email.
[18:11:33] Oliver: they do not pass either one
[18:11:58] ? neither the real email nor the first + lastname in one field
[18:12:12] sampo.kellomaki: Ok, decision now: do I reconfig my IdP to pass in urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6 something like FRsLTG-ZdKuVJ-Pes_MiQ44cz@zxidp.org 
[18:12:28] Oliver: sure that looks good
[18:12:39] sampo.kellomaki: or do you just add the @zxidp.org to the persistent pseudonym I pass to you (i.e. no change for me)?
[18:13:15] ? I take it that you pick the first option. Very well. It will take me perhaps 20min or so.
[18:15:37] Oliver: ok that would really be the best solution
[18:15:52] ? i am looking at a way how i could put the name together on my side
[18:16:07] sampo.kellomaki: I suspect there are other sysadmins who would appreciate this as well.
[18:16:16] Oliver: but it would probably take longer that 20 mins
[18:17:02] ? this is the config for shib + confluence
[18:18:52] ? https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/SHBL/How+to+Shibbolize+Confluence
[18:19:43] ? ok gotta run to the store will be back in 30 mins
[18:19:59] sampo.kellomaki: Ok, I'll do the same. Back in 30 min.
[19:10:48] ? Back.
[19:01:38] Oliver: oral exam
[19:02:53] ? oops wrong window
[19:44:05] Sampo Kellomäki: I am now sending urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6 but I still am not considered logged in.
[19:44:40] Oliver: let me look at the log one sec
[19:49:34] ? was the format
[19:50:23] ? you are sending it as urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified
[19:50:37] ? added it to the attribute map and now it works
[19:50:54] Sampo Kellomäki: Should I tweak my code to send something other than unspec?
[19:51:23] Oliver: no it is fine i added it to the attribute map
[19:51:42] Sampo Kellomäki: I see protectednetwork sent urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri
[19:51:51] ? Perhaps I do the same.
[19:52:02] Oliver: ok
[19:57:59] Sampo Kellomäki: Ok, now I see my login succeed.
[19:58:31] ? I'll implement the Recipient work around Scott suggests.
[20:12:25] Oliver: just forwarded you another mail from scott that i have received
[20:14:32] Sampo Kellomäki: In the Recipient case it is not clear what should go to that field.
[20:15:15] Oliver: i don&apos;t know either
[20:15:24] ? :(
[20:17:06] Sampo Kellomäki: I'll put the EntotyID URL and we will see.
[21:05:59] ? Works with the Recipient workaround.
[21:06:18] ? On the Kantara site, where can I edit my test user's profile?
[21:08:58] ? I notice you lowercase the persistent pseudonym when you form the username. You realize that my uniqueness guarantee assumes full 64 character characterset. By lowercasing you loose nearly one bit of search space :-)
[21:09:02] ? Out of 128.
[21:09:16] ? I guess you are still ok, statistically speaking.
[22:11:14] Oliver: that is an intersting point
[22:11:31] ? i wonder if confluence does that or the shib plugin
[22:12:00] ? you can edit your userprofile when you click on your name
[22:12:26] ? and then there should be a dropdown menu with the item profile
[22:12:48] ? once on your profile you need to click on the edit link
[22:13:02] Sampo Kellomäki: No doubt this needs JavaScript...
[22:15:45] ? The user name appears in the "Full Name" field. Is there no provision for human readable nick name?
[22:16:06] Oliver: you can just overwrite that
[22:16:19] ? click on the edit link
[22:16:36] ? it is put in there if no name is passed from the idp
[22:16:51] ? confluence probably needs something in there
[22:16:53] Sampo Kellomäki: The internal federated username is just initial value for Full Name - I see.
[22:18:13] Oliver: yup
[22:18:45] Sampo Kellomäki: Ok, appears to work.
[22:19:30] ? I'll make a new release of zxid and upgrade idp.tas3.eu to the latest and greatest. Then we can consider this issue closed for time being.
[22:19:40] Oliver: cool

97.13.4 Non-obvious ID-WSF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Should you include Sender SOAP header? Conor says usually
    not. But how do you then know SOAP request issuer? Perhaps
    from some field of the signature?

2.  In case bearer token is <EncryptedAssertion>, how is
    env->Header->Security->SecurityTokenReference->KeyIdentifier
    populated (normally it would be populated from Assertion->ID)?

97.13.5 Non-obvious XML Exclusive Canonicalization (XML-EXC-C14N)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XML Exclusive Canonicalization bugs cause vast majority of signature
failures (once trivial configuration issues like using wrong
certificates are taken care of). Here are some gotchas:

1.  XML namespace prefixes must be tracked correctly and they
    can alter at every layer, even reusing already used
    prefixes.

2.  InclusiveNamespaces/@PrefixList namespaces must always be
    rendered. However, if the list inclides a prefix that in
    fact has not been declared in parent node of the canonicalization,
    then this prefix is supposed to be ignored (says Scott Cantor, 20101005).
    I have not found any specification references saying this to be
    the case. In fact [XML-EXC-C14N] section 3, bullet 2, and section
    3.1, bullet 3.2.1, seem to imply otherwise. However if the prefix
    has not been declared, it is not easy to see how the spec could
    be satisfied (unless a bug leaks the declaration from inside
    the canonicalized element, such as ~ds~ from embedded signature).

3.  Pay attention to line end canonicalization ([XML-C14N], section 1.1
    "Terminology", 3rd bullet): CRLF to LF. Many implementations
    only ever produce NL, or avoid producing any superfluous whitespace at
    all (best strategy to avoid interop problems), and therefore work fine
    until the day when CRLF emitting implementation appears.

4.  Namespace declarations are ordered by namespace prefix, while
    namespaced attributes are ordered by namespace URI. Gotcha!

97.13.6 I do not want to know service type, but I want to call the service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 if possible i would be able to create a new structure zx_a_EndpointReference_s
[11:50:11] ? from scratch where i can set the url that can be get from
[11:50:21] ? zxidjni.get_epr_address(cf, epr);
[11:59:00] sampo.kellomaki: Hmm. EPRs are complex objects. Even if you created a blank EPR with just URL in it, it would not be all that useful without the <Metadata> and especially <SecurityContext> with token within.
[11:59:52] Gulyx: ok i see
[12:00:05] ? however as we discussed in sophia
[12:00:35] ? the statement : SWIGTYPE_p_zx_a_EndpointReference_s epr = zxidjni.get_epr(cf, zxses, &quot;x-recurs&quot;, null, null, null, 1);
[12:00:52] ? may be moven from the axis2 zxid module
[12:00:59] ? to the application level
[12:01:23] ? in this way the developer can choose
[12:01:27] sampo.kellomaki: It is also suboptimal that the datatype is as ugly as zx_a_EndpointReference_s. Since EPRs clearly have arisen to be a concept that user of the API actively have to known about, I should typedef that to be zxid_epr or something.
[12:02:01] Gulyx: ...
[12:02:07] ? sorry i am lost
[12:03:48] ? what i am saying is that a developer of a web service client can explicitely define a url, or may use your disco in order to look for the most appropriate one
[12:04:07] sampo.kellomaki: I am saying that EPR, being common documented concept, should not be SWIGTYPE_p_zx_a_EndpointReference_s, but should be named zxid_epr.
[12:04:30] Gulyx: ok
[12:04:51] sampo.kellomaki: Explicitly defining URL is inadequate unless you also define the security token to access the service.
[12:05:28] ? Generally creating security token without consulting discovery (or ID Mapper service in more general context) is not feasible.
[12:05:45] ? THerefore having a simple constructor for EPR accomplishes very little.
[12:06:36] Gulyx: mmm
[12:07:15] ? what i am saying is that is due to the developer of a web service client choose
[12:07:17] sampo.kellomaki: If you know the URL (and the service has been registered to discovery), then you can get the EPR with zxidjni.get_epr(cf, ses, svc_type, URL, null, null, 1).
[12:07:29] Gulyx: an explicit url or look for one from a disco
[12:07:58] ? thus this part of the zxidapi should be used (in case) at the application layer
[12:08:05] sampo.kellomaki: Rather than look for URL from disco, why not just get the EPR from disco, i.e. call get_epr()?
[12:08:08] Gulyx: and not in the zxid security module
[12:09:01] sampo.kellomaki: What would you do with the EPR created by the constructor?
[12:09:30] Gulyx: well it is ok to use  &quot;zxidjni.get_epr(cf, ses, svc_type, URL, null, null, 1).&quot;
[12:09:59] ? however is not always given that &quot;svc_type&quot; is known/available
[12:10:13] ? what happen if it is not provided?
[12:10:21] ? that it may be possible
[12:10:45] ? i understand that is important from a discovery point of view
[12:11:23] ? but the coould be the case in which the developer of a web service client do not want to use it or does not know it
[12:11:39] ? he would only contat that URL
[12:11:54] sampo.kellomaki: If you do not know service type, how do you know what kind of SOAP body you are supposed to send to the service?
[12:12:47] ? Developer of the web service ultimately is the authority that decides what the service type URI. If he does not know it, he can just invent it.
[12:13:03] Gulyx: for example because i am executing a RPC and i got all the information from the wsdl
[12:13:29] ? in this case i simply need a URL
[12:14:00] ? isn&apos;t it ?
[12:14:17] sampo.kellomaki: As a general rule, if web service developer has poor imagination in inventing a service type URI, I recommend using the namespace URI of the top level element in the SOAP body.
[12:14:45] Gulyx: sampo i am not saying that what you are proposing is wrong
[12:15:03] ? i am just sayin that in some cases people does not use the service type
[12:15:03] sampo.kellomaki: To speak RPC, you do need to know how to format the SOAP body according to the RPC marshalling conventions.
[12:15:22] ? CLearly you need to know what the body looks like, therefore you should know its namespace.
[12:15:33] Gulyx: and the zxid module in axis shuould support both
[12:15:59] sampo.kellomaki: If people do not use service type, then they can not get registered in discovery.
[12:16:14] Gulyx: so the case in which the developer (at the application level) specified the service type and the case when he does not
[12:16:22] sampo.kellomaki: If they are not registered in discovery, how do you propose to generate the token for accessing the web service?
[12:16:59] Gulyx: &quot;[15.18.49] sampo.kellomaki: If people do not use service type, then they can not get registered in discovery.&quot; ????
[12:17:20] ? should a client be registered to a disco?
[12:17:27] sampo.kellomaki: That's right. Registering without service type is not possible.
[12:17:38] Gulyx: no sorry
[12:17:59] ? probably i was
[12:18:06] ? saying something in the wrong manner
[12:18:16] ? let&apos;s start again
[12:18:27] ? service MUST have a service type
[12:18:39] ? service MUST register to a disco with a service type
[12:19:12] ? clients SHOULD know the service type and MAY use it in order to look for a service
[12:19:33] ? client MAY contact directly a service without knowing a service type
[12:19:49] ? client MAY not be registered to the disco
[12:19:55] ? ok?
[12:22:11] sampo.kellomaki: Client is need not be registered in Disco.
[12:22:22] Gulyx: ok
[12:22:25] ? perfect
[12:22:37] sampo.kellomaki: However, I claim that client can not contact the service without knowing what the SOAP body looks like.
[12:23:08] Gulyx: of course
[12:23:40] ? but they can also do it from the wsdl
[12:23:59] ? ?
[12:24:01] ? as i said above
[12:24:45] sampo.kellomaki: Yes, knowing WSDL constitutes knowing what the SOAP body is.
[12:25:02] Gulyx: ok
[12:25:08] sampo.kellomaki: If you know WSDL, you know what the namespace URI of the top level element of the SOAP body is.
[12:25:25] ? Now if you follow the convention that the namespace is the service-type, then you are done.
[12:25:37] Gulyx: so a client may not know the service type
[12:25:56] sampo.kellomaki: If the service developer chose  a service type different from the namespace, then you have to find out from the documentation the service developer provided.
[12:25:59] Gulyx: (i am not saying that is the most appropriate or the only way to do it)
[12:26:07] ? yes
[12:26:11] ? of course
[12:26:33] ? i am only proposing to include into the zxid axis2 module
[12:26:38] ? both the possibility
[12:26:43] ? possibilities
[12:26:49] ? with and without service type
[12:27:30] ? (sorry i got a call back to you soon)
[12:32:59] sampo.kellomaki: If you want to support the without service type case, then you should program in the axis2 module automatic derivation of the service type using the rule that the namespace of the top level element is the service type.
[12:37:41] Gulyx: (back)
[12:39:38] ? well if is it possible to forge from the service url an &quot;appropriate&quot; epr that i can pass to the zxidjni.wsc_prepare_call
[12:39:56] ? i would prefere
[12:40:15] ? what do you think?
[12:40:24] sampo.kellomaki: If you "forge" wrong, then things will not work.
[12:41:04] Gulyx: if the automatic derivation is wrong ,  then things will not work too :-D
[12:41:07] sampo.kellomaki: Having a default rule like using top level namespace as service type will work if that indeed was the convention everybody uses.
[12:41:25] ? But there is no universal agreement that this is always the convention.
[12:41:36] Gulyx: exactely
[12:41:38] sampo.kellomaki: In practise in Liberty it has been the convention, but there is no guarantee.
[12:42:38] Gulyx: so having something like &quot;zxidjni.get_defaultEpr(URL)&quot;
[12:42:43] sampo.kellomaki: Why are you so hell bent in not wanting to know the service type?
[12:42:47] Gulyx: would be useful
[12:42:53] sampo.kellomaki: What service type do you not know?
[12:43:00] Gulyx: i want service type
[12:43:20] ? and i am almost supporting it into the module
[12:43:49] ? i am just saying that people that i hope would use the module
[12:44:15] ? may not use service type
[12:44:40] sampo.kellomaki: If the people want to play in TAS3, they need to know the service type. Knowing it is a requirement to join TAS3.
[12:44:43] Gulyx: so i would that the module supports both the cases
[12:44:51] ? yes yes
[12:44:55] ? ok
[12:45:04] ? i was referring people out of tas3
[12:45:14] ? i mean if we realese the zxid module for apache
[12:45:27] ? i assume that axis2 users may
[12:45:34] ? prefer zxid module instead of rampart
[12:45:51] ? so i would include this feature into the module too
[12:47:31] sampo.kellomaki: Ok, if you do not want to make TAS3 web service calls and do not want to use identities or security tokens, then plain EPR with just URL would be good enough.
[12:47:57] Gulyx: right

97.14 Best Practises
--------------------

1.  Each entity chooses its own Entity ID. When you are setting
    up a SP, you choose your Entity ID and the IdP(s) MUST be
    able to adapt to your choice. Similarily, an IdP decides
    its own Entity ID and all SPs MUST be able to adapt to it.

2.  Entity IDs MUST be unique within a Circle of Trust (CoT). Given
    that CoT relationships may change from time to time, its best
    to choose Entity ID so that it is globally unique. If Entity ID
    contains a domain name as a component, then the +globally unique+
    property tends to be enforced by the domain name allocation
    system.

3.  Entity ID SHOULD be the Well Known Location (WKL), i.e. the
    URL from which the metadata can be fetched.

4.  Providing metadata by URL, ideally by the Entity ID, SHOULD
    always be enabled. This greatly facilitates configuration.

5.  <KeyDescriptor> elements should have ~use~ XML attribute

6.  After you get an installation to work, be sure to review whether
    the default configuration is appropriate for production use

    a. Decide whether you want to run open federation, see MD_FETCH
       config option (default: 1=open federation)
    b. Prune your Circle of Trust. Use zxcot(8) tool to list who you
       trust and delete the misfits.
    c. Check validity time tolerances you accept: BEFORE_SLOP
       and AFTER_SLOP. The defaults are rather generous for
       production use.
    d. Review that you did not turn off any signature
       validation just to get it to work (SIG_FATAL=0, NOSIG_FATAL=0
       and similar config options). All signature
       validations are there for reason and you should not
       go to production if any of them fail.
    e. Check permissions on /var/zxid/pem and think whether
       your private keys, including web server SSL one,
       are protected. Could they have been compromised
       during trial period?
    f. Check that your public image is conveyed right in your metadata,
       e.g. NICE_NAME, ORG_NAME, ORG_URL, and FEDUSERNAME_SUFFIX (if
       used, generally only on IdP). However, be forewarned
       that changing these on last minute changes your metadata and you may
       need to engage in an additional round of metadata exchanges
       when you go to production.
    g. Make sure you have a solution in place to keep your audit trail
       in case you ever have to go to court. See zxid-log.pd for
       details. You may also want to think about encrypting or deleting some
       items after a while to reduce your liability for breaches.

97.15 Cardspace / Infocard / DigitalMe Tutorial
-----------------------------------------------

N.B. zxid.org does not yet support Infocard, but since we
are starting the investigation, we thought to share
some of it in next sections...

97.15.1 Installing DigitalMe and Firefox plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DigitalMe by Bandit project is an open source Infocard
implementation, providing functionality roughly similar to
CardSpace. You can download it from

  http://www.bandit-project.org/index.php/Digital_Me

rpm2cpio digitalme-0.4.1238-2.1.i586.rpm | cpio -di

97.15.2 Setting up IdP account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For one InfoCard aware IdP, please see: http://www.cdatazone.org/index.php?/archives/27-Managed-Infocard-Demo.html

1. Register at the IdP site (e.g. https://www.ctindustries.net/icard/index.php)
2. Download the card ("Retrieve Managed Card" link (savea as "cdatamanaged.crd" by default).
3. Install the card to DigitalMe

97.15.3 Yubikey Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZXID supports the yubikey USB One Time Password (OTP) tokens from yubico.com.
The token should be personalized such that the prefix of the ticket is the
UID and the remainder is the ticket proper. The AES128 shared secret in hex is
populated in UID/.yk directory. See also zxid-log.pd for description.

You would typically plan the user names, taking in account the yubikey modhex 
restrictions, and then use ykpersonalize to create thephysical tokens. At the
same time you would generate and record the AES128 shared secrets to the .yk
files (and inside the yubikey USB tokens themselves, of course).

The contents of the .yk file is 32 hexadecimal digits (ascii 0-9a-f)
representing 128 bits of key information.

The value is not hashed, salted, or nonced, so it needs to be carefully
protected by the filesystem permissions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microsoft promises to not sue you: http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx

97.17 Attributes
----------------

Q:: I want to read the attributes that come in the assertion. how do I do that?

A:: You get attributes back as an LDIF entry as return value of zxid_simple()
    The attributes are also available by reparsing the assertion, which gets
    stored in /var/zxid/rely hierarchy.

    /var/zxid/ses/SuzZQS5Ub/.ses file contains the path to the assertion file.

Q:: In the zxid directory you store some users. what does the extension .mni stand for?
    Why is the info stored? I assume it is some sort of local cache. I would like
    to store the attributes there too. how do I do that?

A:: The .mni file is used to support Manage NameID requests. In normal operation of ZXID
    it really is not needed, but to support some of the SAML conformance test requests
    it is needed.

    Rather than store attributes in that directory, I'd suggest reparsing
    the assertion when you need them. But if you must, you could create a
    file of your own in that directory. We of course need a naming
    convention that prevents naming conflicts with future versions of
    ZXID: Your file extension should start by ".x-", for example:
    "attributes.x-attr"

Q:: The ldif returned by zxid_simple() is perfect for my needs. but
    nothing is being stored in log\rely directory. could be some
    configuration issue? also, can I have zxid automatically store the
    ldif file returned zxid_simple()?

A:: The log/rely should be populated by default, but if the directory
    structure itself is missing, may be it does not work. Try make dirs.
    Or check that web server user's permissions allow writing there.

A:: Re ldif cached: the logic is supposed to be that the zxid_simple() will
    be called to protect every page, therefore its return value is available
    on every page.

    If you do not call it every time, but instead bootstrap some sort of
    app specific session, then you would strore the LDIF (or the attributes
    parsed out of it) to that app specific session.

97.17 SOAP Binding
------------------

97.17.1 Axis2 wants wsa:Action header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended course of action is to change Axis2 config such that it does not
require wsa:Action header. All the necessary information for dispatch of
the SOAP message is already available on the top child element of SOAP Body element.

HTTP Action header and the wsa:Action SOAP header are historical design errors
as they effectively duplicate information from the top child of the Body. Exactly
how this duplication is to be done is poorly specified and great source of
interoperability problems.

Please point me to a specification document (with line number or section reference)
where wsa:Action is specified as mandatory. Remember that Axis2 is just an implementation
and just because Axis2 happens to want it, does not make it required by any standard.
If you can show it to be mandatory, then point me to document that specifies what
the proper value would be.

Historically many web service specs have been silent on the value of wsa:Action as
they were designed not to use wsa:Action. When people the try to use wsa:Action,
they end up inventing the value themselves and, voila, you have an interoperability
mess.

If you really want to have a wsa:Action  header, you can generate one yourself:

zxid_call(...,"<e:Envelope><e:Header><a:Action>...</a:Action></e:Header><e:Body>...</e:Body></e:Envelope>", ...)

In other words, the zxid_call() family of functions will accept full SOAP envelope if
you give it one. It will then add the TAS3 specific headers to it, but it will preserve
the headers you supplied as long as there is no conflict.

Cheers,
--Sampo

* Official ZXID mailing list is zxid.user@lists.unh.edu
* The archives can be seen at http://listproc.unh.edu/archives/zxid.user

98.2 Bugs
---------

Mail the author until we get bug tracking set up. Or volunteer.

98.3 Developer access
---------------------

We use CVS, but access needs to be manually configured and is not
anonymous. If you contribute significantly, I will bother. Others
can send patches (good way to show you are worthy of CVS access)
to me. I've heard some mixed experiences about open source
sites like sourceforge. If you run such site and want to
host ZXID Project, please contact me.

If you just always want the latest source: get the tar ball from
the downloads section. Trust me, this is still so much in flux
that only the tar ball snapshots are in any usable state. CVS
access just to get latest source would be pointless.

logged in. Your pseudonymous username will appear in top right
of that page. It something like this

fc5y3apqom8upyicon7g6qztx@idp.tas3.eu

6. Click on the username and choose "Profile" to edit the screen name
to be nicer to users (in the internal database the pseudonym
continues to be used so you do not need to worry about the
screen name being acceptable, e.g. duplicate).

7. Once you have your federation enabled Kantara account, you can use
it to join Kantara Work Groups. Their policy is that you do not have
to be Kantara member to login to the site and see the public part
of their work. However, to contribute to their work you need to
be a member (mainly for IPR reasons - to ensure free to implement and use).
This is done by "elevating" the status of your federated login. It is
done by Kantara, not by idp.tas3.eu
