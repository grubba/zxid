Usage: zxcall [options] -s SESID -t SVCTYPE <soap_req_body.xml >soap_resp.xml
       zxcall [options] -a IDP USER:PW -t SVCTYPE <soap_req_body.xml >soap_resp.xml
       zxcall [options] -a IDP USER:PW -t SVCTYPE -nd # Discovery only
       zxcall [options] -a IDP USER:PW   # Authentication only
       zxcall [options] -s SESID -im EID # Identity Mapping to EID
       zxcall [options] -s SESID -l      # List session cache
  -c CONF          Optional configuration string (default -c PATH=/var/zxid/)
                   Most of the configuration is read from /var/zxid/zxid.conf
  -s SESID         Session ID referring to a directory in /var/zxid/ses
                   Use zxidhlo to do SSO and then cut and paste from there.
  -a IDP USER:PW   Use Authentication service to authenticate the user and
                   create session. IDP is IdP's Entity ID. This is alternative to -s
  -t SVCTYPE       Service Type URI. Used for discovery. Mandatory (omitting -t
                   causes authorization only mode, provided that -az was specified).
  -u URL           Optional endpoint URL or ProviderID. Discovery must match this.
  -di DISCOOPTS    Optional discovery options. Query string format.
  -din N           Discovery index (default: 1=pick first).
  -az AZCREDS      Optional authorization credentials. Query string format.
                   N.B. For authorization to work PDP_URL configuration option is needed.
  -im DSTEID       Map session's login identity to identity at some other SP using ID-WSF
  -nidmap DSTEID   Map session's login identity to identity at some other SP using SAML
  -e SOAPBODY      Pass SOAP body as argument (default is to read from STDIN)
  -b               In response, only return content of SOAP body, omitting Envelope and Body.
  -nd              Discovery only (you need to specify -t SVCTYPE as well)
  -n               Dryrun. Do not actually make call. Instead print it to stdout.
  -l               List EPR cache (you need to specify -s SEDID or -a as well)
  -v               Verbose messages.
  -q               Be extra quiet.
  -d               Turn on debugging.
  -dc              Dump config.
